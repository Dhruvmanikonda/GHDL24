        <h4 class="header-1-news-seperate">Arjit and Yash secure the title for NFC in dramatic 2-1 win over DPS in the final</h4>
        <p class="introduction-1-news-seperate"">The much anticipated final to claim the maiden GHDL title took place between NFC and DPS Khajaguda on the 17th of December, 2023.  NFC claimed the title after a gritty 2-1 victory over determined rivals DPS Khajaguda.</p>
        <p class="body-1-news-seperate-1"">The first half saw a determined performance by both the teams. Scores were level until the 30th minute when Aditya of DPS Khajaguda broke the deadlock with a fabulous run and finish after an error in midfield by NFC’s Anish and Dhruv.</p>
        <p class="body-1-news-seperate-2"">NFC played a route one, counter attacking style of football as compared to DPS Khajaguda who dominated most of the 
            possession throughout the affair. Several shots were exchanged by both teams for 15 minutes after the whistle blew to begin the second half. As Arjit, 
            the Goalkeeper of NFC caught the ball after a high cross from Pavan of DPS, he would never have imagined the scenes that then occurred. He punted the ball across the field till DPS Khajaguda’s box and then the ball took a bounce in front of the DPS keeper and bounced 
            above him and into the goal. Arjit leveled it for NFC at the 45th minute mark. With this new found momentum, NFC constantly attacked DPS Khajaguda’s goal. In the 51st minute, Ambarish Inani of NFC launched a free kick into the box which eventually fell to the feet of 
            Yash who tucked it into the back of the net. NFC led the visitors at the 51st minute stage. DPS responded to these goals with attacks of their own but Arjit made a series of sensational saves to keep them out of his net. Nimish of DPS Khajaguda struck the crossbar in 
            the 55th minute while NFC’s captain Dhruv nearly increased the lead for NFC with a left footed strike in the 57th minute.
