        <h4 class="header-3-news-seperate">Learn about the NFC team that fought their way to the title</h4>
        <p class="introduction-3-news-seperate"">NFC put up a courageous and gritty show for everyone to watch and eventually ended up as champions of the first GHDL season.</p>
        <p class="body-3-news-seperate-1"">The champions started their campaign off with a 1-0 win against Mastergrade FC in a cagey affair thanks to Dhruvâ€™s 37th minute winner. Their next match was against eventual group toppers USFC in which they defended tough and resisted the constant USFC attacks but eventually lost due to defensive miscommunication during a corner. All the team required to qualify for the next round was a draw against Sreenidi B but instead took home all 3 points after Sreenidi B was unable to play in the last group match. </p>
        <p class="body-3-news-seperate-2"">The champions also got a free ticket to the final after Sreenidi A withdrew from the tournament after unfortunate circumstances. This left the team with only one obstacle in their way which was in the form of a rampant DPS side. NFC displayed a gritty performance yet again and took home the championship trophy.
