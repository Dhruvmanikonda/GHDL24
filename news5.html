        <h4 class="header-5-news-seperate">Learn about the DPS team that missed out on the title by the finest of margins</h4>
        <p class="introduction-5-news-seperate"">DPS finished second in the inaugural GHDL season but were not meant to even be part of the knockout stage. DPS only qualified for the playoffs after Hyderabad Little Stars withdrew from the tournament and the rest was down to their hard work and determination. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-5-news-seperate-1"">DPS Khajaguda started their campaign with a 3-0 win over Phoenix FC. Their next match was against eventual group toppers Sreenidi A in which they were completely outclassed by a 5 star showing from the Sreenidi side and lost 8-0. All the team required to qualify for the next round was a win against Hyderabad Little Stars but instead the match ended in a 1-1 draw with Little Stars advancing to the playoffs on Goal Difference. However, Little Stars withdrew from the tournament which allowed DPS to face USFC in the semi final.        </p>
        <p class="body-5-news-seperate-2"">The champions also got a free ticket to the final after Sreenidi A withdrew from the tournament after unfortunate circumstances. This left the team with only one obstacle in their way which was in the form of a rampant DPS side. NFC displayed a gritty performance yet again and took home the championship trophy. 
        </p>
        <p class="body-5-news-seperate-3"">DPS Khajaguda performed to the highest standard in one of the games of the tournament and beat USFC on penalties due to a great performance from their goalkeeper, Vikhyath. This left the team with only one obstacle in their way which was in the form of a resistant NFC side. DPS displayed a catchy, possession based style of football but eventually lost the final 2-1 due to defensive and goalkeeping errors.</p>
        <p class="body-5-news-seperate-4"">Nevertheless, it was a memorable campaign for DPS Khajaguda in the first season of the GHDL. </p>
