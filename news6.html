        <p class="introduction-6-news-seperate"">In a nail-biting semi-final that pushed both teams to their limits, DPS Khajaguda emerged victorious after a dramatic penalty shootout against USFC. After scores tied at 2-2 after regular time, the fate of the finals spot hinged on the nerves of steel and precision kicks from the spot.</p>
        <p class="body-6-news-seperate-1"">The match itself was a rollercoaster of emotions. DPS had taken the lead through Naman in the 10th minute, but USFC fought back with an equalizer from Arya in the 15th minute. Aditya then sent DPS ahead in the 44th minute but USFC equalized yet again in the 49th minute with a special goal from Ronald. Both teams had chances to win it in regulation, but the score remained locked, setting the stage for the ultimate test of composure â€“ the penalty shootout.</p>
